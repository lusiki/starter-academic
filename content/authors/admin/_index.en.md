I am a Professor of Statistics at the Croatian Catholic University in Zagreb, where my work spans Data Science, Big Data, Machine Learning, Econometrics, and Finance. Through my freelance engagements in Data Science, I bring real-world insights and cutting-edge analytics into both my research and classroom. In addition to teaching, I actively collaborate with colleagues across various disciplines, developing innovative statistical methodologies to tackle complex data challenges.

My passion lies at the intersection of economics, data science, and education. I frequently speak at conferences and workshops on topics such as advanced analytics and data-driven decision-making, always striving to bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical applications. From designing intricate models to producing compelling visualizations, I find every aspect of data exploration irresistible.

Beyond academia, I stay active through sports and embrace the rejuvenating challenge of ice baths. I’m equally fond of fueling my creativity with vegetables, coffee, and computational problem-solving. Ultimately, my mission is to empower students, professionals, and organizations with robust, data-informed insights that shape a more informed and impactful future.
